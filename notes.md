### Notes

#### CRUD
- CRUD - Happens at the database level of MVC architecture
- Stands C(create) R(read) U(update) D(delete)
- Columns - attributes
- Active Record (ORM - Object Relational Mapper) - used as the middleman between the rails code and the database. It translates the communciation between the two, so you don't have to type in SQL code, using ruby code instead.
- With Active Record, you can simply right ruby code, that will translate to SQL, and interact with your database
